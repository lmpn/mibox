# mibox

MiBox is an application that intends to provide a free storage solution.
The idea is that it should a replacement for GDrive or Dropbox.

This is built using a client-server approach, and Rust. This idea
has born because I'm trying to deep dive into performance and networking topics.

For sake of simplicity this will start as a terminal based application meaning
that no fancy UI to drag and drop files. The Features I intend to implement are:
[] File upload
[] File download
[] File listing
[] File search
